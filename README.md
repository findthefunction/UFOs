##  Overview of Project: 

Collecting and analysing data is great, but how would you like to let your visitors sort through the data themselves? By using HTML and Javascript we have created an interactive webpage that filters data once users have inputed the information.

##  Results:

Upon visiting the website users will see the page as we have designed it. Depending on the method used to access site (mobile, desktop etc...), the information is presented either side by side with the filtering tool or stacked for better viewing.  The initial loading of the page shows all data for the viewer to scroll through. They have the option of entering 5 different filter parameters. They can utilize any number of these filters to obtain the sought after information.

##  Summary:

The page works well and you will find hours of entertainment combing through UFO encounters and having a blast with you friends and family!  The site is great, however we could optimize the user experience by giving them controls over the resetting of filters and also creating dropdown filter menus to mitigate errors in spelling or users entering search terms that arent within out data base.  Logging searched terms and stoing them for later review could also allow us to expand upon the data set by researching most commonly searched items and items that may belong inside out table of greatness.
